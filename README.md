🧠 Chatbot with Python

A simple and interactive Python chatbot that demonstrates basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and user input.
This chatbot engages users in a friendly conversation — greeting them, asking for their name, guessing their age using modular arithmetic, counting numbers, and testing programming knowledge with a small quiz.

🚀 Features

💬 Friendly interaction: Greets the user and remembers their name.

🧮 Age guessing: Uses math (remainders with 3, 5, and 7) to calculate the user’s age.

🔢 Counting demo: Counts up to any number the user provides.

🧩 Programming quiz: Tests the user’s understanding of programming concepts.

✅ Error handling: Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

🖥️ Command-line interface: Simple to run and requires only Python.

🛠️ How It Works

The chatbot performs a series of steps:

Greets the user with its name and creation year.

Asks for the user’s name and gives a friendly compliment.

Guesses the user’s age using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Counts from 0 up to a number the user chooses.

Runs a small quiz to test basic programming knowledge.

Ends with a friendly goodbye message.

🧩 Code Overview

The main functions in the code are:

greet(bot_name, birth_year) – Introduces the chatbot.

remind_name() – Asks for and remembers the user’s name.

guess_age() – Calculates the user’s age using modular math.

count() – Counts up to a number entered by the user.

test() – Asks a multiple-choice question to test the user’s knowledge.

end() – Displays a goodbye message.

⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.6 or later

No external libraries needed — runs on pure Python.
